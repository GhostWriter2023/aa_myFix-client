# aa_myFlix-client

Objective
    Using React to build the client-side of a web application focused on movies. This application will allow users to access information about various movies, directors, and genres. Users will have the ability to sign up, update their personal details, and curate a list of their favorite movies.

Context
    This project involves creating a REST API for a web application called "myFlix," which interacts with a database containing movie data. Subsequently, the client-side component of the application will be built using REACT. By completing this project, you will showcase proficiency in full-stack JavaScript development, including APIs, web servers, databases, authentication, and more, using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.

Project Overview
    The following sections provides information about the requirements for the app.
